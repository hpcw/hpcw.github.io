# HPCW @ISC2021

The workshop 'High Performance Container Workshop' will take place virtually on 02-July-2021 from 2PM to 6PM CET.
It assembles thought leaders to provide the 'state of containers' and user-stories to showcase what can be done and where the bounderies are.<br>

## Event Setup

Due to COVID19 and the virtual nature of the event, the workshop will last only 4 hours. Thus we will focus on user stories and have a panel of specialists discuss each use-case from different layers in the ecosystem.

## Call for Participation
We are looking for use-cases and user-stories to dicuss during our workshop. Please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nadxRUbXitpvjURWqmoSMayiEw9joI_4gpt9vST9JAI): 

* **We are searching for problems, no need to provide the answer along with it**. The goal of the workshop is to provide insights on what works and what does not work for containers in HPC. Please also submit your use-case even though it might turn out that we end up without a solution in 2021. It will help us to discuss where we need to improve or define what is not (yet) possible.
* **We are a friendly group**. Please do not hesitate to reach out because you are worried to be hammered by the experts. We will make sure that the level of interactive engagement suits you, potentially have someone be a proxy standin.
* **Edge cases are welcome**. You have a problem with a unique challenge; get in touch!
