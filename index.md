**The workshop is taking place on July 2nd**.

The **H**igh **P**erformance **C**ontainer **W**orkshop series assembles thought leaders to provide the 'state of containers' and the latest trends.

# Virtual HPCW 2022

ISC2022 moves back to in-pweron in the beautiful city of Hamburg. We submitted a proposal for a workshop similar to what the installment of 2019 ([qnib.org/2019/06/20/isc2019-hpcw](http://qnib.org/2019/06/20/isc2019-hpcw/)).

We'll dive deep into each aspect of containers in HPC (runtime, build, distribute, schedule, HPC specifics). An emphasis is put on MPI/PMI and how labels and annotation can be used in different scenarios.

# Agenda

**Once accepted, we will update this page and add the current agenda**
